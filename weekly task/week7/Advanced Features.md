## Tasks

### 1. Implement Branching and Control Flow Instructions

**Overview:**
Branching and control flow instructions allow the CPU to change the flow of execution based on conditions or jump to specific instructions in the program.

**Steps to Implement:**
1. **Define Branch Instructions:**
   - Examples: `JUMP`, `JUMP_IF_ZERO`, `JUMP_IF_NOT_ZERO`, etc.
   - Modify the program counter (PC) based on the condition.

2. **Update the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle:**
   - Add support for branch instructions.
   - Use flags (e.g., zero flag, carry flag) to evaluate conditions.

**Example:**
```assembly
LOAD R1, 5       ; Load 5 into register R1
DECREMENT R1     ; Decrement R1
JUMP_IF_NOT_ZERO 0x03 ; Jump to instruction at address 0x03 if R1 is not zero
```

### 2. Add Support for Subroutines and Interrupts

#### Subroutines
**Definition:** A block of code that can be called and executed, then return control to the caller.

**Steps to Implement:**
1. Add instructions like `CALL` and `RETURN`.
2. Use a stack to store the return address when calling a subroutine.
3. On `RETURN`, pop the return address from the stack and set the PC to that address.

**Example:**
```assembly
CALL Subroutine
...
Subroutine:
   ADD R1, R2
   RETURN
```

#### Interrupts
**Definition:** A mechanism where the CPU can handle external or internal events asynchronously.

**Steps to Implement:**
1. Reserve specific memory locations for interrupt handling (Interrupt Vector Table).
2. Add an `INTERRUPT` instruction to simulate interrupt triggers.
3. Save the current state (PC, registers) on the stack before jumping to the interrupt handler.
4. Restore the state after handling the interrupt.

### 3. Integrate a Simple Pipeline Mechanism

**Overview:**
A pipeline allows the CPU to process multiple instructions simultaneously by breaking down the instruction execution into stages.

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Fetch:** Retrieve the instruction from memory.
2. **Decode:** Interpret the instruction.
3. **Execute:** Perform the operation specified by the instruction.

**Steps to Implement:**
1. Divide the execution cycle into multiple stages.
2. Use pipeline registers to store intermediate results between stages.
3. Handle pipeline hazards (data, control, and structural):
   - Add stalling or forwarding mechanisms for dependencies.

**Example of 3-Stage Pipeline:**
```plaintext
Cycle 1: Fetch Instruction A
Cycle 2: Decode Instruction A, Fetch Instruction B
Cycle 3: Execute Instruction A, Decode Instruction B, Fetch Instruction C
```

### Final Integration
1. Update your Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to include branching, subroutines, and interrupts.
2. Test these features with sample programs:
   - **Branching:** Loops and conditional statements.
   - **Subroutines:** Modular function calls.
   - **Interrupts:** Event-driven tasks (e.g., timer or I/O).
3. Ensure pipeline works efficiently without breaking existing functionality.

### Expected Outcomes
- The CPU can handle conditional jumps and loops efficiently.
- Subroutines allow modular code execution.
- Interrupts enable event-driven programming.
- The pipeline increases instruction throughput.
