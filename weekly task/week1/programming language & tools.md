
# Programming Language and Tools Selection

## Programming Language
- **Python**
   - Pros: Easy to write and read, extensive libraries for emulation and simulation, strong community support.
   - Cons: Slower execution speed compared to C++.

- **C++**
   - Pros: High performance, closer to hardware-level programming, fine control over memory management.
   - Cons: More complex syntax, longer development time.

## Tools

1. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
   - Options: VS Code, PyCharm for Python, or CLion for C++.
   - Justification: A robust IDE provides debugging tools, version control integration, and easier code navigation.

2. **Version Control**
   - Tool: GitHub or GitLab.
   - Justification: Essential for tracking changes, collaborating, and managing versions effectively.

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Python: Pytest or Unittest.
   - C++: Google Test or Catch2.
   - Justification: Ensures the CPU functions as expected and facilitates early error detection.

4. **Documentation**
   - Tools: Sphinx (for Python) or Doxygen (for C++).
   - Justification: Creates comprehensive documentation for the codebase, which aids future development and collaboration.

## Conclusion
The chosen programming language and tools provide a strong foundation for the project, balancing ease of development and performance.
