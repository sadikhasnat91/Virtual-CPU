## Introduction
This document outlines the primary features and scope of the Virtual CPU project. The goal is to design and implement a functional virtual CPU that can perform basic computational tasks through a simulated environment.

## Core Features

1. **Basic Instruction Set**
   - Define fundamental operations that the CPU can execute, such as arithmetic, logic, and data movement.
   - Examples include operations like ADD, SUBTRACT, LOAD, STORE, and JUMP.

2. **Registers and Memory Management**
   - Specify the number and types of registers (e.g., general-purpose registers, program counter).
   - Define memory access methods and any limitations for data storage and retrieval.

3. **Instruction Cycle**
   - Describe the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle that the CPU will follow.
   - Explain how the virtual CPU processes instructions sequentially to perform tasks.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Outline mechanisms for handling invalid instructions or memory access violations.
   - Define how the CPU will respond to errors (e.g., halt, display an error message).

5. **Extensibility**
   - Highlight the possibility of adding new instructions or modifying CPU components.
   - Consider future enhancements such as advanced instruction sets or pipeline processing.

## Optional Features
Additional capabilities that could be integrated include support for I/O operations, floating-point arithmetic, or multi-core simulation.
